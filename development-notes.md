# Development Notes

I have some experience developing R packages; I have very little experience developing JavaScript packages.

My goal here is to document the steps I take to get a TypeScript library up-and-running. The goal of this TS library is to provide the JS to "power" an R htmlwidget. One way to achieve this goal is to follow in the footsteps of Vega-Lite.

## Steps

I created this repository.
